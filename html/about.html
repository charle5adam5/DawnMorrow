        <p> Dawn Morrow, B.A. is a Dance MFA Candidate of 2017. She attends Hollins
          University for her graduate degree. She has been dancing for over 20 years.
           She currently teaches primarily Jazz, Modern, and contemporary forms.
           She grew up in Jacksonville, Florida where she trained and taught at local
            studios, as well as danced with The Florida Ballet. In 2005, she moved
            to Los Angeles. Some of her credits include: Nickelodeonâ€™s Victorious,
            recurring appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, over 20 music
            videos, films such as Walk Hard and Struck By Lightning, National
            commercials for brands such as Coca-Cola, Tampax and Kia, and has had
            the opportunity to work with choreographers such as Anne Fletcher and
            Michael Rooney.
          </p>

          <p> Her commercial experience in Los Angeles creates a colorful backdrop of movement
           with the merging of her recent master's studies centering on contemporary dance
            and "branding" of dancer as "product."
          </p>

          <p> She also has an extensive background in the convention/competition world. Her
          choreography is unique, thought-provoking, and outside the box while incorporating
           technical virtuosic forms. Several judges awards, as well as first place trophies
            have been won with her work.

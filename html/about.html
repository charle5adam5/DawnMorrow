      <p class='intro'> Dawn Morrow, M.F.A. graduated from Hollins University
        with her Master of Fine Arts in Dance and graduated from Saint Mary's of
         California (LEAP Program) with a Bachelor of Arts in Performing Arts. She has been dancing for
        over 25 years. She currently teaches primarily Jazz, Modern, Improvisation,
        and Contemporary forms. Morrow grew up in Jacksonville, Florida where
        she trained and taught at local studios, as well as performed with The
        Florida Ballet, FSCJ, and Orange Park Community Theater. She currently
        lives in Saint Augustine, Florida.

      <p> In 2005, Morrow moved to Los Angeles to pursue the entertainment
        Hollywood. Some of her performance credits include: Nickelodeon's
        Victorious, recurring appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,
        over 20 music videos, films such as Walk Hard and Struck By Lightning,
        National commercials for brands such as Coca-Cola, Tampax and Kia, and
        has had the opportunity to work with prestigious choreographers such as
        Anne Fletcher and Michael Rooney. She also trained primarily during this
        time at the EDGE Performing Arts Center in Hollywood, CA.

      </p>

      <p> Her commercial experience in Los Angeles has created a colorful backdrop
        of movement with the merging of her recent master's studies centering on
        contemporary and modern dance forms. Morrow combines her traditional training
        and contemporary artistic practice with a commercial L.A. edge.

      <p> She also has an extensive background in the convention/competition dance
        scene. Her choreography is unique, thought-provoking, and “outside the box”
        while incorporating virtuosic techniques. Several judges awards, first place,
        top of category, and high score trophies have been won with her work, as
        well as seen in commercials, music videos, and in live performance for
        various dance companies.

      <p> Her passion for teaching began in her Senior year of high school and
        has developed into a career teaching dance to students of all ages,
        specializing in 8 year olds to adults. She believes dance is a right, not
        a privilege and has a passion to keep dance alive and relevant within her
        community, as well as throughout the world.
